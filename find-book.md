# Dewey Decimal

1. The first step is to figure out the main class of the topic you are looking for. that will be the first decimal on the left.
2. The next digit will be the division that you are looking for. 
3. The next digit will be the section.
4. Once you have the three main digits you will have a decimal place to further divide the topics.

This method lends itself to a tree structure but with more than two child trees available to each parent. Each tree only needs to have 10 values and then each of those 10 values will have a sub tree with 10 more subtrees. We can then search through the subtree looking for the specific value.
